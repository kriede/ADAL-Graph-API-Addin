# WordAddin-Office365UnifiedAPI-ADALJS-Demo

#Description
Sample application using the Office365 unified API in a Word add-in. 
A user can select an email address in their Word doc, hit a button and the add-in will pull back all the information Office 365 knows about that user. 
The add-in uses an email address as it is unique for each user.
